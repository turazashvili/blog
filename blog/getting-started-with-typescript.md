# Getting Started with TypeScript

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

## Why TypeScript?

- **Static Typing**: Catch errors at compile time.
- **Better Tooling**: Enhanced autocompletion and navigation.
- **Readability**: Types serve as documentation.

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```
