# AI Assistants Are Becoming the New Search Engines — But Who Measures the Attention?

## The Shift: Users Now "Ask the AI"

Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming how users search for information. Instead of typing queries into Google, millions now rely on **AI assistants**, creating a new form of **AI search behavior**. With ChatGPT exceeding **4.6B monthly visits** and younger generations adopting GenAI tools as their primary search interface, we’re entering a new era where **AI-driven search** replaces traditional engines.

👉 This shift concentrates attention inside conversations — a space with **no analytics and no visibility**.

### Key Indicators of the Shift

* ChatGPT now receives **over 4.6B monthly visits**.
* **36%** of GenAI users say they replace traditional search with AI assistants.
* AI tools provide instant answers without directing users to external sites.

This change turns **prompts into the new keywords** — high-intent signals that describe what users truly want. Yet unlike search keywords, prompts are not tracked, measured, or monetized.

## Prompts: The Missing Signal in the New Search Economy

Marketers rely on keyword analytics, CPC data, CTR benchmarks, and search volume to understand and monetize intent. This system fuels the entire search advertising economy.

But **LLM conversations break this model**.

Prompts inside AI assistants are:

* Untracked
* Unpriced
* Unstructured
* Invisible to developers, publishers, and advertisers

This creates a massive blind spot in the emerging **AI search ecosystem**. As user behavior shifts toward AI, businesses lose the ability to understand user demand, optimize content, or engage audiences at the right moment.

## Attention Has Moved. Analytics Haven’t.

In the world of **AI-powered search**, attention lives inside the conversation — not on webpages.

But most LLM apps lack **prompt-level analytics**, leaving publishers unable to:

* See what users are asking
* Identify intent patterns
* Connect prompts to valuable outcomes
* Monetize user attention in a meaningful way

Advertisers also lose access to the core signal that drives their industry: **intent**.

The result is a multibillion-dollar gap at the heart of the AI economy. Attention is growing — but it’s completely unmeasured.
